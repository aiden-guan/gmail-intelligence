/**
 * Protocol versioning between the PigeonBox extension and PigeonBox Cloud.
 *
 * Compatibility rules:
 * - `PROTOCOL_VERSION` is a major version. It changes only for breaking changes:
 *   a removed route, a renamed field, a field whose meaning changes, or a field that
 *   becomes required in a request.
 * - Additive changes keep the version: new routes, new optional request fields,
 *   new response fields, new capabilities, new error codes.
 * - Clients ignore response fields and capabilities they do not know.
 * - The server accepts every version listed in `supported` and rejects others with
 *   `unsupported_protocol` (HTTP 426), so an old extension gets a clear message.
